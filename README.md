# GUI for controling Keithley 2610B System Source Meter: Measuring Resistivity 

Bachelor's thesis project for the development of a resistivity measuring device using an in-house designed 4 point probe, 2 point probe technique and Van Der Pauw method. This repository includes the MATLAB code used for the control of the system using a GUI.

The code was developed for the Institute of Nuclear Sciences in Mexico City and the Center of Applied Sciences and Technological Development (formerly CCADET now ICAT). Relevant parts of the code are in spanish. The GUI is used to control a Keithley 2610B System Source Meter and can control the maximum and minimum values of current or voltage sourced to the probe. It also controls the measurement of the current and voltage respectively. These measurements are used to calculate the corresponding resistance/conductance values. Together with the sample dimensions the conductivity and resistivity can be estimated across different voltage/current values.
